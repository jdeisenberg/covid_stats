# COVID 19 Statistics

This program displays COVID-19 cases for the last 7 days or since January 2020,
either as totals or per 100,000.

The reason I wrote this is that most of the media only report total cases, which always puts New York at the top (since they had so many cases and have a large population). However, it is useful to see the “latest” information, both as an absolute number and in proportion to the population.
